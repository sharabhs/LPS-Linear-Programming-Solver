# LPS - Linear Programe Solver
This package is used for solving a linear programming problem, it is capable of handling of minimization was well as maximization problems.
The package contains a command line solver which can be interfaced with Matlab. It also contains a Graphical User Interface(GUI) thats adds on top of the solver making it easier to use the solver.

The solver was written as a part of class assignment in EE5900 under the guidance of Dr.Sumit Paudyal at Michigan Tech in the spring of 2016.
